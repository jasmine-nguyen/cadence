description: Run the build graph for a card or request
---

Run the build pipeline using `build_graph.py`.

Read `project-context.md` for the board data source ID.

## Resuming a stopped build

If the user says "resume" or "continue the build" (and `$ARGUMENTS` is
empty or says "resume"), check the conversation for the last paused build.
You'll have the thread ID and card number from the earlier run. Resume with:
`python3 build_graph.py --thread <id> --resume "go"`
Then continue from step 3 below.

## Starting a new build

1. Figure out what to build:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` looks like a card number (e.g. WHIT-123), fetch the
     card's title and description from Notion first.
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a plain-text request (not a card number), create a
     new card on the board first: use `notion-create-pages` with the board
     data source, set Type = 'Task', Status = 'To Do', and a clear title.
     Once created, fetch the card to get its assigned number.
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, pick the next actionable card from the board:
     query the data source for Type = 'Task' and Status IN ('To Do',
     'In Progress'), ordered by Priority ASC, first row. Fetch it.
   - Echo which card you're building and why before continuing.

2. Run the script:
   `python3 build_graph.py --card <number> --details "<title and description>"`

   While it runs, give the user short status updates based on the output.
   The script prints which node is running and what tools it's using. Relay
   the key milestones:
   - "Designer is planning..." (when you see `designer running`)
   - "Plan critic is reviewing..." (when you see `plan_critic running`)
   - "Implementer is coding..." (when you see `implementer running`)
   - "Code review in progress..." (when you see `code_critic running`)
   - "QA testing..." (when you see `qa running`)
   Don't flood — one line per node is enough.

3. If the script pauses (prints "Paused. Resume with:"), summarise the
   plan for the user before asking. Show:
   - **Task:** what we're building (1-2 sentences, plain english)
   - **Plan:** the approach (bullet points, plain english, no jargon)
   - **Risks:** anything to watch out for (or "None" if clean)

   Then present options using AskUserQuestion:
   - "Approve" — resume with "go"
   - "Rework" — ask for feedback, then resume with that feedback
   - "Stop" — end the build, don't resume

4. Based on the user's choice, run the resume command shown in the output
   (e.g. `python3 build_graph.py --thread <id> --resume "go"`)

5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the script prints "Done."

6. Once done, update the card's Status to 'Done' on the board.
